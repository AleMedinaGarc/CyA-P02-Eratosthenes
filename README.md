# CyA Lab assignment (lab, class presentation with slides) structure

This directory is organised as follows:


├── docs               # All kind of project documentation
├── Eratosthenes.md    # The assignment description
├── img                # Image resources if needed
├── LICENSE
├── README.md          # This file
├── src                # Source code
└── tests              # Source code for tests, if included


For each assignment there should be a markdown file with the assignment description.
Find that file and follow the instructions on it.

**Before** the evaluation session of the assignment, **do not forget** to upload the (git) link to your repository to the Moodle classroom.
